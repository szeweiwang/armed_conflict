## Data Loading and Initial Overview

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
library(corrplot)

# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("/Users/wangsiwei/Desktop/version_control/armed_conflict/data/analytical/finaldata.csv", header = TRUE)

# Display the first few rows
head(data)

# Overview of the structure of the dataset
str(data)

# Summary statistics
summary(data)
```

## Univariate Analysis

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gdp1000)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of GDP (in 1000s)", x = "GDP", y = "Frequency")
```

The distribution of GDP shows that many countries have lower GDPs (skewed to the right), with some outliers having much higher GDP values.
